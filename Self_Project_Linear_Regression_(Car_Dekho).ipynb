Next, you need to try if regularizing your model helps you perform well on the test dataset. For this, use <code> Ridge</code> and <code>Lasso</code> regressions on the dataset and check for different values of the tuning parameter ($\\lambda$ or $\\alpha$ , do not confuse this $\\alpha$ with the learning rate.)
